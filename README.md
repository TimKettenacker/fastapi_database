# fastapi_database
I wanted to check the feasibility of FastAPI interacting with a database

To interact/test the stack, just fire up the server from within the project directory using "uvicorn sql_app.main:app --reload".

On 127.0.0.1:8000/docs, you can first create a user using POST and then GET all created users.
